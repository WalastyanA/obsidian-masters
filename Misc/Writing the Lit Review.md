- Integral citations 
	- When the names come first
	- When there is less agreement about the topic, there is more discussion in the literature 
	- Focusing on who made the claim, **THIS PERSON** said this
- Non-integral citations
	- When the information comes first then the author(s) in brackets
	- You want to focus on the information because most people agree

To do a good literature review, you should do both, summarising the information that most people agree about as well as discussing the more contentious information.
Ensure you show that you are thinking about the information that you are putting in your lit review. The verb you choose is important
