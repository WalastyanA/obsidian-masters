You need to incorporate ideas and information from other sources to support your own ideas. Anything you get from another source should have a reference, and should the vast majority of the time be paraphrased or summarised. Direct quotes are only really to be used when the **exact** wording is essential. 

## Necessary Changes
- You don't have to paraphrase very specific technical language but anything general you should. 
- Changing word forms is a good way of paraphrasing. If you change quick -> quickly means you will have to rewrite the whole sentence. 
- Add citations, even if it comes from something you have written.
- Don't change the meaning
