## Introduction
#### Purpose:
- Give the reader a general understanding 
- Enable the reader to fully follow the logic of your argument and that they are coming into your writing from the same place you are. The reader may not be an expert in the area. You need to make sure they have the same starting point that you do.
#### Elements:

- Hook - not essential but sometimes good to have a first sentence that engages the reader and makes them want you read your article
- Definitions - if there is some debate about terminology or if there is room for interpretation within terminology you will need to define how YOU are using them in your essay in the introduction. If it's something common knowledge then you don't need one. If it's something new or still debated then do define it. You only really need to define key terms.
- Justification - What are you trying to do, are you trying to propose a new idea, do you want to further explore the topic. Quite broad.

## Main Body
Anything after the introduction

> [!NOTE] Main Body – Paragraph Structure
> **Topic Sentence** → **Explanation** → **Evidence & Examples** → **Possible Counter-arguments with Evidence** → **Conclusion**

Topic sentences just state the main idea of that paragraph, telling the reader what it's about.

There is some more variation in how you can organise paragraphs. You can have something we call an **opinion structure**:

Opinion 1
Opinion 2
Opinion 3
Opinion 4
etc. 

Each opinion could be one paragraph or it could be several paragraphs. This could be in any order, the opinions don't have any set order. You would go for this if it is a shorter piece of work or there is not much research. Not really a thing at masters level. Shorter and less formal. You would organise this in the order that seems right to you. 

Another structure is **compare & contrast** structure. This structure is similar but more connected:

Opinion 1
	 ⬇️
Direct opposite

This has the opinion and opposite as the sections following each other. This is the one you see most often, especially with cutting-edge research. Really for this, the paper disagreeing should basically directly disagree with the opinion

Another structure is **advantage-disadvantage**

Another structure is **theme based**.

Another structure is **chronological**. This is very common in literature review sections where you need to give some historical development. 

Another structure is:

Proposal
	 ⬇️
Evidence 1
	 ⬇️
Evidence 2
	 ⬇️
etc. 

You can combine all of these, e.g. having an advantage disadvantage inside a compare & contrast structure. You don't have to tell people you are using these structures, but plan to use one and stick to it.
