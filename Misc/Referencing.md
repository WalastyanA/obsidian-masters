## Referencing and Citation
- Always do it
- General rule of thumb, don't just quote everything. For taking direct quotes don't really take more than two sentences. Try not doing this much.
-  Use Harvard. Here is the [[University of Leicester Author-Date Harvard 2024.pdf|full referencing guide]].
- If you can't get access to a reference but someone else has used it you can say something like "(Smith 1900 as cited in Johnson 2015)"
- Try to avoid references to non-reputable non-academic sources like webpages or non-academic videos or forums or blogs BUT if it's useful you can but don't base your stuff on it. Say like "at present this stuff has not gone through academic peer review but it shows promise"
## Being Critical 
- Talk about the reliability and limitations of the research/references you are using 
- You argue something 
- How could the thing be improved
